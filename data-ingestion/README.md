# data-ingestion

Python ingestion scripts for all three data sources. All commands run from the project root via [Task](https://taskfile.dev).

## Sources

### Spotify (batch)

Pulls top artists, top tracks, and recently played history from the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). Requires a Spotify Developer app and OAuth — a browser window opens on first run to authorise access; the token is cached for subsequent runs.

| Entry point | Destination | Task commands |
|---|---|---|
| `data-ingestion/ingest.py` | `data/spotify.duckdb` → `raw_spotify.*` | `task ingest`, `task ingest:no-cache-clear` |

See [data-ingestion/spotify/](spotify/) for OAuth setup and output table schemas.

### StatsBomb (batch)

Fetches free open football data (competitions, matches, events, lineups) from the [StatsBomb open-data GitHub repository](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data). No authentication required. Ingestion is incremental — already-loaded matches are skipped.

| Entry point | Destination | Task command |
|---|---|---|
| `data-ingestion/ingest_statsbomb.py` | `data/spotify.duckdb` → `raw_statsbomb.*` | `task ingest:statsbomb` |

### NBA (batch)

Downloads historical NBA box scores (core + extended, 1947–present) from the [Kaggle NBA dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores) via `kagglehub`. Requires Kaggle API credentials (`KAGGLE_USERNAME` / `KAGGLE_KEY` in `.env`). Each file is a full-replace load, so re-running picks up the daily-updated upstream snapshot. The large play-by-play parquet is skipped.

| Entry point | Destination | Task command |
|---|---|---|
| `data-ingestion/ingest_nba.py` | `data/spotify.duckdb` → `raw_nba.*` | `task ingest:nba` |

See [data-ingestion/nba/README.md](nba/README.md) for credential setup and output table schemas.

### OpenF1 (batch)

Fetches Formula 1 timing data (meetings, sessions, drivers, laps, pit stops, stints, weather) from the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org). No authentication required. By default it ingests every season from 2024 through the current calendar year. `meetings` and `sessions` are full-replaced per season (delete-by-year, so the range accumulates); the five per-session tables are incremental — already-loaded sessions are skipped, so the script resumes safely after a partial run. OpenF1 rate-limits, so requests are paced with 429 backoff. Set `OPENF1_START_YEAR` / `OPENF1_END_YEAR` to change the range and optionally `OPENF1_SESSION_LIMIT` (cap sessions per run, newest first).

| Entry point | Destination | Task command |
|---|---|---|
| `data-ingestion/ingest_openf1.py` | `data/spotify.duckdb` → `raw_openf1.*` | `task ingest:openf1` |

### Crypto — Binance (streaming)

Streams real-time trade ticks for BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT from the [Binance public WebSocket API](https://developers.binance.com/docs/binance-spot-api-docs/web-socket-streams). No authentication required. Runs as two long-lived processes: a producer that pushes ticks into a Kafka topic, and a consumer that reads from Kafka and writes to DuckDB plus a live JSON sidecar.

| Component | Entry point | Destination | Task command |
|---|---|---|---|
| Producer | `data-ingestion/crypto/producer.py` | Kafka `crypto.trades` topic | `task crypto:producer` |
| Consumer | `data-ingestion/crypto/consumer.py` | `data/crypto_raw.duckdb` + `data/live_data.json` | `task crypto:consumer` |

See [data-ingestion/crypto/README.md](crypto/README.md) for Kafka setup and topic configuration.
